Hi 7peaks,

Thank you for the task, it was quite an interesting one.

Because of limited time, it decided to focus mostly on functionality so it's not the most beautiful app but it's responsive for mobile and desktop

- i decided to play around with react hooks and the context api for this project
- had trouble getting articles by their id,  inorder to create a detail page for each article(i coulnd find it anywhere on the nytimes documentation) so used a modal that when clicked on will display more info cause i ran out of time.
- on the acceptance criteria unit tests weren't needed so didnt write any or check proptypes
- material ui was used for design cause i particularly like material libraries and design guidelines

to run application
- simply run npm install on the command line
the run 
- npm start

Thank you very much for the project, hope you like it
